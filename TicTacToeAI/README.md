# Tic Tac Toe AI – Flask Web App

An interactive Tic Tac Toe web application where a human plays against an unbeatable AI. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm from game theory to always choose the best possible move.

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence, search algorithms, and Flask web development can be combined to build an intelligent browser game. Features

---

## Human vs AI gameplay

AI never loses (Minimax algorithm)

Web interface using Flask

Interactive browser-based board

Game stops after win/draw

Reset button to start a new game

---

## AI Algorithm Used — Minimax

Minimax algorithm evaluates all possible future moves and selects the optimal one. This makes the AI player unbeatable.

## Technologies Used

Python

Flask

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

---

## How to Run the Project?

1)Install Flask

py -m pip install flask

2)Run the app

py app.py

3)Open in browser

## How to Play?

You are O

AI is X

Click on any cell to make a move

After win/draw, the board freezes

Press Reset to start a new game

---

## Concepts Learned

Game state representation

Recursion and backtracking

Minimax search algorithm

Flask routing and templates

Frontend–backend interaction using JSON

---
## Outcome

This project proves how basic AI search techniques can be used to create intelligent and interactive web applications.
