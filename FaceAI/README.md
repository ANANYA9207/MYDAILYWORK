# Face Recognition Application using OpenCV

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an AI-based Face Recognition system that detects and recognizes human faces from images.  
It uses OpenCV’s Haar Cascade classifier for face detection and the LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) algorithm for face recognition.

The system allows users to:
- Train a model using a dataset of labeled face images
- Upload an image and identify the person in the image
- View detected faces with predicted names and confidence scores
